Bootdisk Setup
==============

This document gives instructions on how to set up a bootdisk for Phoenix.

Requirements:

+ NASM
+ Open Watcom
+ A floppy disk or a floppy disk image.

### Instructions

## Prepare the System

* Go into the src directory.
* Type 'wmake.' This builds the Phoenix system.
* Go into the src/tools directory.
  + Build memalign using 'wcc386 memalign.c'
  + Build copyboot using 'wcc386 copyboot.c' (only needed if you are using a floppy image)
* Go into the src/boot directory.
* Type 'nasm boot.asm -o boot.bin.'

## Prepare the Floppy

* If using a physical floppy, insert it into drive A: (it is essential the disk be in drive #0).

* If using a disk image (on Linux, for example), do the following:
  + Be sure the mtools package is installed. Set the MTOOLSRC environment variable to point at
    images/mtoolsrc.
  + Go into the images directory.
  + Create the image with the command
    $ dd if=/dev/zero of=floppy.img count=2880
  + Format the image with the command (note that a: is bound to the image by mtoolsrc)
    $ mformat a:

## Copy the Boot Sector

* If using a physical floppy
  + Type 'debug boot.bin.'
  + Type 'W 100 0 0 1.'
    This writes starting at address 100 to drive 0, sector 0, length 1 sector.
  + Type 'Q' to quit.

* If using a disk image
  + Type '../src/tools/copyboot ../src/boot/boot.bin floppy.img.'
    This copies the boot sector from boot.bin onto the first 512 bytes of the floppy image.

## Copy Executables

* Go into the src/boot directory (if you aren't there already).
* Type 'wmake' to build loader.com.
* Type '../tools/memalign loader.com.'
* Copy the new bloader.com file to the floppy disk. (Use mcopy for floppy images)
  Be sure the name is upper case on the disk (use 'mdir a:' to check).
* Copy any of the apps that you want to be able to run to the floppy disk. (Use mcopy if needed)
  Be sure the names are upper case on the disk.
